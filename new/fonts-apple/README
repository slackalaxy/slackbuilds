Fonts for Apple platforms

Get the details, frameworks, and tools you need to use system fonts for Apple
platforms in your apps. These typefaces offer the control and flexibility to
optimally display text at a variety of sizes, in many different languages,
across multiple interfaces.

SF Pro
This neutral, flexible, sans-serif typeface is the system font for iOS, iPad OS,
macOS and tvOS. SF Pro features nine weights, variable optical sizes for optimal
legibility, four widths, and includes a rounded variant. SF Pro supports over
150 languages across Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts.

SF Compact
Sharing many features with SF Pro, SF Compact features an efficient, compact
design that is optimized for small sizes and narrow columns. SF Compact is the
system font for watchOS and includes a rounded variant.

SF Mono
This monospaced variant of San Francisco enables alignment between rows and
columns of text, and is used in coding environments like Xcode. SF Mono features
six weights and supports Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts.

New York
A companion to San Francisco, this serif typeface is based on essential aspects
of historical type styles. New York features six weights, supports Latin, Greek
and Cyrillic scripts, and features variable optical sizes allowing it to perform
as a traditional reading face at small sizes and a graphic display face at
larger sizes.
